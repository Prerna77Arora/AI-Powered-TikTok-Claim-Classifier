# CaseStudy--Tiktok_Claim_Classifie
# AI-Powered TikTok Claim Classifier üé¨

This project is the **Course 6 End-of-Course Portfolio Project** from the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**.  
The goal is to **build, evaluate, and summarize** a machine learning model that classifies TikTok videos as either **claims** or **opinions**, helping the moderation team prioritize user reports efficiently.

---

## üìå Project Overview

TikTok receives a large number of **user reports** on videos that may contain **claims** or **opinions**.  
Currently, human moderators review these reports, which can lead to delays.  

By creating a **predictive machine learning model**, TikTok can:  
- Reduce the backlog of reports  
- Prioritize critical content for review  
- Improve the efficiency of content moderation

## üìä Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and explore the claims classification dataset
   - Handle missing values and convert text into numerical features (TF-IDF)
   
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create features from `video_transcription_text`
   - Combine with numeric and categorical features

3. **Model Development**
   - Train classification models using:
     - **RandomForestClassifier**
     - **XGBoostClassifier**
   - Optimize using **RandomizedSearchCV** with cross-validation

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate using:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-score
   - Select the model with the **best recall score** (prioritizing claims detection)

5. **Results & Insights**
   - Present model results in the Jupyter notebook
   - Create an **executive summary** for stakeholders
